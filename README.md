# Deep Active Learning for Defect Classification in PyTorch

This repo is inspired from Akshay L Chandra [DAL-pytorch](https://github.com/acl21/deep-active-learning-pytorch) and modified to suit the defect classification usecase.  

## Active Learning Methods used
* Entropy
* Random
* Deep Bayesian Active Learning (DBAL)
* Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD)


## Datasets Supported
The dataset used in this research was published in Kaggle by (Dhabi, 2019) owners of the casting industry Pilot Techno Cast.
* [Casting product image data for quality inspection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravirajsinh45/reallife-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product)
